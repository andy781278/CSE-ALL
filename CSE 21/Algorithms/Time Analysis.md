#Algorithm 

$$a < log(log(n)) < log(n)^k < n < nlog(n) < n^k < a^n < n! < n^n$$

Runtime depends on:
- Input size
- Number of steps the algorithm requires
- Time for each step
	- Dependent on hardware: age, component, manufacturer, temperature
	- Dependent on software: OS, language, data structure, background processes

You usually multiply runtime for loops, but only for O, not for $\Theta$. 

#  T(n)
The function for calculating runtime is T(n)
