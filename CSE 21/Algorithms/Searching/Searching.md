#Algorithm #Searching
### WHAT
Looking for an element in a list

![[Linear Search]]
![[Binary Search]]

Binary Search is **asymptotically** faster than Linear Search (takes less time, and also takes less time the bigger the values are)

$\frac{T_{BS}(n)}{T_{LS}(n)} \rightarrow 0$  as  $n \rightarrow \infty$
$T_{BS}(n) \in o(T_{LS}(n))$
