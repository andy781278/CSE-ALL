#Algorithm
Similar to Induction, but we are solving a problem

We must first have a base case
how to solve a problem of size n+1 assuming we can solve a problem of size n

Inductive Hypothesis: The algorithm is correct on all inputs of size (up to) k

Goal (Inductive Step): Show that the algorithm is correct on any input of size k+1
