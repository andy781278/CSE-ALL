#Counting
For any set A, $|A*A*A*…| = |A|^n$
- For counting num len of strings
- Binary strings length n has 2^n possible strings
	- bc binary can only have 0 or 1 for A, which makes the 2
- N is number of slots, A is possible choices per slot
- Link this to strings over an alphabet

Used for fitting 1 thing from A in each slot if there are n slots
