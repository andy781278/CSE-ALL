#Counting
number of ways to arrange r objects out of n positions/spots/slots
$P(n,r) = _nP_r = n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-r+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$

you can think of it as each space is a different role, therefore each is different from the others, similar to ordering, each space in the order is different from the others because of its unique position in the string/set
