#Probability

1. Define $X_i$ where X is the thing you are looking for, and $X_i$ is a way to divide up the X into small individual things with probabilities you can calculate
2. Make a rule stating X_i is 1(true) if it satisfies the requirements requested
3. find Probability of X_i at 1, or find the probability of a single instance being true
4. It probably is uniform, so we then add all the expected values of the individual X_i together
