#Probability
Probability of flipping k heads in n Bernoulli trials when the probability of success is p

Example:
P(H) = 0.2, P(3 heads in 8 coin flips) = $\binom{8}{3}(0.8)^5(0.2)^3$
a typical outcome with 3 heads in 8 coins would be h h t h t t t t

In other words, probability, only in binomial sets (0 or 1, heads or tails), where it could be unevenly distributed, the probability of getting k successes in n tries is:
$$P(k) = \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$$
