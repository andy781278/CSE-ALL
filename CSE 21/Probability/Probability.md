#Probability
same thing as counting, but different names

Sample Space -> Set
Outcomes -> Element
Events -> Subsets
Experiment/Trial -> procedure that yields a possible element

[[Distribution]]
this in probability means a function
$$p:S \rightarrow [0,1]$$
($[0,1]$ means a range from 0 to 1 inclusive)

And it has to have the following property:
$$\sum_{a\in S}p(a)=1$$
