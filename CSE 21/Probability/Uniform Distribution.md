#Probability
east outcome has the same possibility.
Since there are |S| outcome and and sum of all outcomes is 1, each outcome's probability is $\frac{1}{S}$
We are probably only using this one
Conditional probability are when probability of an outcome is defined by an equation, then integrals are required (I kinda want that but ok)
