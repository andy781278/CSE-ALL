#Probability
## $$P(A|B)$$
Probability of an event may change if have additional info about outcomes

Suppose A and B are events, and P(B) > 0 , then:
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$
$$P(A\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$$
P(A|B): Probability of A given B

[[Law of Total Probability]]

Problem:
P(J) = 0.51
P(C) = 0.29
P(J$\cap$C) = 0.16
P(J|C)  = 0.16/0.29
