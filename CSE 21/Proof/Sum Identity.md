#Proof
Theorem: $\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} = 2^n$

Proof:
Algebraic:
uhh not nessesary to write it down
Combinatorial:
RHS: Count all binary strings of length n (product rule)
LHS: 

Example:
$$
n=4,
2^4 = 16 = \binom{4}{0}+\binom{4}{1}+\binom{4}{2}+\binom{4}{3}+\binom{4}{4}
$$
$$1 + 4 + 6 + 4+1$$
This shows that all combinations can be split into 0 of something + 1 of something... + all of something
