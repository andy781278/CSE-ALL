#Proof
Procedure:
start with base case: pick n=1, and show that it works
induction hypothesis: assume replace with k for some int k>=1 is true
induction step: make k+1 true as well, can put in induction hypothesis if appropriate
conclude that it work

CAREFUL: don't do operations on both sides like add/sub/mult/div bc it is technically not proven that they are equal, to do that would
