#Proof
(n k) = (n n-k)

basically, nk and n n-k is the same result in combination, like 10 3 and 10 7 is the same

Proof:
(n k) counts the numebr of [[Fixed Density]] binary strings of length n with k ones
(n n-k) counts the num of [[Fixed Density]] binary string with length n with n-k ones
if they have bijection, [[bijection]] proves that they're same (cardinality is equal)
if you flip all the bits, then there is a bijection?
