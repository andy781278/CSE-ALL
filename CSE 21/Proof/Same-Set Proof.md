#Proof
. Find a set <- define this first clearly (Let S be the set...)
2. explain why the LHS counts this set <- do 2 and 3 separately, no moving terms in between
3. explain why the RHS counts this set
Example
$\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} = 2^n$
4. Let S be a set of all binary strings length n
5. $2^n$ counts the number of binary strings length n
6. We compute the Summation, creating a partition of many subsets added together. For example, all n length strings with k=0 ones, k=1 ones,..., k=n ones. This accounts for all n length strings
