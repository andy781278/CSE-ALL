#Proof
find a set counted by the LHS
2. find a set countd by the RHS
3. build a bijection between these two sets
Example
$\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}$
4. the set of all binary strings with length n and k 1s
5. the set of all binary strings with length n and n=k 1s
6. consider that the map that changes all 1s into 0s and all 0s into 1s, it is a bijection between two sets above
