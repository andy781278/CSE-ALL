#Proof
theorem: $\binom{n+1}{k}=\binom{n}{k-1}+\binom{n}{k}$ ^fa69ab

Proof 1: just math it

Proof 2:
LHS: (n+1 k) is the num of fix den binary strings of length n+1 with k ones
RHS: (n k-1) is num of fix den binary strings of length n with k-1 ones
and (n k) is the num of fix den bin string with length n and k ones

Split into 2 sets, one ends or begins with 0 and another ends or begins with 1
each set accounts for each one on the RHS
