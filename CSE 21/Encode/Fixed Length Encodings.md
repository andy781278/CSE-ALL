#Encode 
Fixed Length Character-By-Character Encoding
How to be lossless? Has to be 1 to 1
Size of domain has to be less or equal size of codomain
What this means is that **every symbol is encoded to be the same number of bits**
Works best when the frequency of characters are roughly the same

| Domain | Codomain |
| ------ | -------- |
| A      | 1        |
| B      | 2        |
| C      | 3        |
|        | 4        |

|Data| <= |Binary string length n| = $2^n$
$log_2$|Data| <= n
