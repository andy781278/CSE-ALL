#Encode
Encoding is the process of translating an object or datum into bit strings
Types of stuff to encode:
- Text
- Sounds
- Images
- Videos
- Programs
- Math Objects

Encoding means also to be able to decode, so that data isn't completely lost

Three kinds of encoding:
- Lossy Encoding
	- Some data is lost, for images and videos, compress better and lose little bit of quality
- Error Detecting/Correcting Encoding (Not in this class)
	- A way to solve disrupted/modified bits by putting in some redundancy so that original code can be recovered
- **Lossless Encoding** (What we're doing)
	- Data can be restored without losses
	- All encodings can be decoded

Next, we tried to experiment to see how much we can reduce of list of numbers that adds up to 100

Theoretical Best: $Log_2 (\binom{109}{9}) = 42$, let's try to accomplish it
