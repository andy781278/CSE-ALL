1. High Level
2. Mid Level
3. Low Level
4. Implementation Level

First, make high/mid level, consisting of mathematical structures and abstractions (sets, relations, ordering, graphs, ...), no details, no implementation

Then, make the low level or implementation level where you match the correct data structures to the mathematical structures and make the details

Advantages of high level
- Clarity - present main ideas so its easier to understand
- Correctness proof - easier to do on high level, as long as the low level does what the high level specifies
- flexibility - we can choose the specific data structure to solve different kinds of problems given the situation with the same high level structure

Advantages of low level
- Details - knows exactly what it does
- Implementation - strict guidelines makes it easier to translate into code
- Time analysis - high level might not be detailed enough to know time analysis
