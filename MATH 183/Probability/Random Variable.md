Every random variable has:
1. A mathematical Symbol representing it: X,Y,Z
2. A support, supp(X): determines the nature of the random variable
3. A probability distribution$P_x$, determines the probability of the random variable taking specific set of values in its support
4. Measures of central tendency and dispersion
	- central tendency: expectation E(X)
	- measure of dispersion: variance Var(X)
